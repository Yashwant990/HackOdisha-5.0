## Problem Statement

Navigating the increasingly complex job market is a challenge for many individuals, as they struggle to identify career opportunities aligned with their skills and interests. Additionally, access to personalized and actionable career guidance is often limited or costly.

Traditional career counseling services and generic online advice fail to provide tailored recommendations based on an individualâ€™s unique resume and skill set. Users also lack clear pathways and up-to-date information about skills and trends required to thrive in their chosen fields.

Career Mentor addresses these challenges by:

- **Extracting skills** from resumes in multiple formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX) through robust text processing.
- **Predicting relevant career paths** using a trained machine learning model.
- **Providing rule-based career recommendations** to complement model predictions.
- **Delivering step-by-step career roadmaps** that clearly outline the skills and technologies to learn.
- **Tracking user progress** with interactive roadmap checklists.
- **Sharing current and emerging industry trends** to keep users informed and competitive.
